              I am from Ghana, where my favorite food is fufu and groundnut
              soup. Back home, I work as a pharmacist, but I am currently
              studying computer programming at Seneca Polytechnic in Canada. I
              have a diverse set of skills including React, Express, MongoDB,
              PostgreSQL, C++, HTML, JavaScript, and React Native. Additionally,
              I am passionate about technology and enjoy exploring new tools and
              frameworks to enhance my development capabilities.
              <br />

              This semester, I am working on my WEB322 assignment, a project
              built using Express, JavaScript, HTML, and styled with Tailwind
              CSS and DaisyUI. This project will span the entire semester, with
              continuous development and improvements. It aims to showcase my
              ability to integrate different technologies and create a robust
              web application. I am excited about this opportunity to apply my
              knowledge in a practical setting and to further expand my
              programming skills.
